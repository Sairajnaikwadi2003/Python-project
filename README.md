Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is implemented using Python and provides a user-friendly command-line interface.

Card Game
The Card game is a fun and interactive game where players take turns playing cards from a deck. The game can be customized to support various card games, such as Poker, Blackjack, or Rummy. It utilizes Python to handle card shuffling, dealing, and gameplay mechanics.

Both projects are designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts, including logic, data structures, and control flow, while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.
